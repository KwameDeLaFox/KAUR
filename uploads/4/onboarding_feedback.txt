INTERVIEWER: Thanks for joining us. Let's talk about your experience with the new mobile app.
PARTICIPANT: Sure. I found the onboarding a bit confused.
INTERVIEWER: Can you elaborate?
PARTICIPANT: There were too many steps. I just wanted to get to the dashboard. But once I was in, the charts were really helpful.
INTERVIEWER: What about the colors?
PARTICIPANT: The dark mode is great, but the red alerts are a bit too aggressive.
